-- digit factorial chains.


-- I need to figure out how to memoize, then return.


-- 3 loops: 169, 871, 872

-- find non-repeating chain (eliminate the first member that repeats)
-- chain starting with 69 has 5 terms.

-- with starting number under one million, how many chains of exactly 60

-- simple way:: end chain if a number is in any of 4 chains.
-- then afterwards, if the end of the chain is a certain number,
-- add to length of count

-- recalcultaing the last in the chain adds a *n to O().
