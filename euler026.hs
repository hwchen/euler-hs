-- gut was right after seeing pattern of 1/6n giving longer periods as n increased.
-- ah, 100 didn't catch it because I test 3 period to make sure 3 digits in a row
-- doesn't abort.
-- oops, doesn't work... some very long periods. as I increase upper bound.
-- up to 5000, still giving higher periods. period 982 at number 983 is highest so far.
-- 6000 and 7000 give same answer.
-- How could I have done it better? 

-- This seems a little like chaotic behavior: complex behavior arising out of simple
-- rules. I wonder how this maps?
