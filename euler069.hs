-- totient maximum
-- two numbers are relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1.
-- totient function is:
-- n divided by number of numbers less than n that are relatively prime.

--totient function is phi

-- Speedup: instead of using Set. When filtering, to check if isRelativePrime, stop if a
-- common divisor is found.

-- 9240 is 4.8125
-- what's the greatest common divisor? looks like 840
-- 840 might be enough space in list. No, so move onto 9240

-- 924000 is 4.8125, in 4 min 40 s with bang patterns (did they prevent memory leak?

-- divisorlist at 1 million takes too long. How to speed up? can't really memoize.

-- usig multiples of 9240, found 960960, ratio 5.2135415, 50 minutes! And still not the right answer!
