-- euler 39, integer right triangles
-- generate all right triangles whose perimeter is 
-- less than or equal to 1000.

-- which perimeter has the most solutions?

-- Don't worry about limit, go until c <= 1000

-- weird, adding in calcPerimeters after rightTriangles actually lowers the runtime
-- from 10 seconds to 5 seconds? and rest of program is negligible. total about 6s
